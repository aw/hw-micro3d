# Documentation

See the detailed documentation in the [docs/](docs/) directory:

  * [EXPLAIN](docs/EXPLAIN.md): learn the story behind this PCB, safety information, and OSHW
  * [HOWTO](docs/HOWTO.md): more detailed information on testing and wiring patterns
  * [REFERENCE](docs/REFERENCE.md): learn about the pinouts, trace widths, and other technical information
  * [TUTORIALS](docs/TUTORIALS.md): a quick guide to **get started** using this module

**Updated PCB v.2 now supports hotend heater cartridge, thermistor, and PWM fan.**

These instructions are for the **PCB v.2**. Please [click here to read instructions for PCB v.1](https://github.com/aw/hw-micro3d/releases/tag/v1).

**Note:** **PCB v.1 is not compatible with PCB v.2** due to the rerouted traces/wiring.

# Features

  * Form factor 80mm x 41mm
  * Lead-free, RoHS compliant
  * PCB traces are 0.5mm and can support at most 1A of current
  * High-current PCB traces are 3.0mm and can support at most 3.9A of current (2A tested)
  * Grounded M3 mounting holes connected to GND pins
  * Easy to source off-the-shelf through-hole components
  * Simple passive design draws 0mA current when no devices are connected
